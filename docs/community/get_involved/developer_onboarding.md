### Third Party Frameworks & Libraries

To build Pyrsia's decentrazied network we made some architectural design decisions for **_peer to peer_** communications. These require us to use a few protocols and their third party implementations. Here is a list of few major items

- AutoNat
- Identify
- Kademlia
- RequestResponse
- Aleph BFT
